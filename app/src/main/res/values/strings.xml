    <string name="txt_mulan">Mulan is an upcoming 2020 American epic fantasy war drama film directed by Niki Caro, with the screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Lauren Hynek and Elizabeth Martin, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. The film is based on the Chinese folklore “The Ballad of Mulan” and is a live action adaptation of Disney\'s 1998 animated film of the same name. The film stars Liu Yifei as the eponymous character, alongside Donnie Yen, Jason Scott Lee, Yoson An, Gong Li, and Jet Li in supporting roles.  Plans for a live-action Mulan remake began in 2010, but the project never came to fruition. In March 2015, a new attempt was announced and Caro was hired to direct in February 2017. Liu was cast in the title role in November 2017, following a casting call of 1,000 actresses, and the rest of the cast joined over the following year. Filming began in August 2018 and lasted through November, taking place in New Zealand and China.  Mulan is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 27, 2020.</string>
